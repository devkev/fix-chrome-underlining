fix-chrome-underlining
======================

Unpacked "Fix Chrome Underlining" extension from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fix-chrome-underlining/haebmhfkidapephfmkapgdoebgfhlldh (offered by https://r1ch.net).

Useful for those who prefer to install extensions manually rather than directly from the chrome web store.

Original description from the store:

> This extension restores the underlining behavior of previous Chrome versions (text-decoration-skip-ink: none).
> 
> It requires permission for all websites to inject the CSS. The extension will never be sold or modified beyond this release.

The only modification beyond the 1.0 version on the store is adding the ability to apply the extension to `file://` URLs.  I also plan to never update this repository beyond this 1.1 tag.
