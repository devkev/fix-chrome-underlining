fix-chrome-underlining
======================

Unpacked "Fix Chrome Underlining" extension from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fix-chrome-underlining/haebmhfkidapephfmkapgdoebgfhlldh (offered by https://r1ch.net).

Useful for those who prefer to install extensions manually rather than directly from the chrome web store.  The original extension has since been removed from the store - a good reminder of why you should prefer to install extensions manually anyway.

Original description from the store:

> This extension restores the underlining behavior of previous Chrome versions (text-decoration-skip-ink: none).
> 
> It requires permission for all websites to inject the CSS. The extension will never be sold or modified beyond this release.

Changes beyond the 1.0 version on the store:

- 1.1: Ability to apply the extension to `file://` URLs.
- 1.2: Don't allow sites to override this extension.
- 1.3: Work correctly even when `text-decoration-skip-ink` is on elements other than `body`.

I do not plan to update this repository further.
