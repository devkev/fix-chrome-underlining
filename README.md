fix-chrome-underlining
======================

Unpacked "Fix Chrome Underlining" extension from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fix-chrome-underlining/haebmhfkidapephfmkapgdoebgfhlldh (offered by https://r1ch.net).

Useful for those who prefer to install extensions manually rather than directly from the chrome web store.

Original description from the store:

> This extension restores the underlining behavior of previous Chrome versions (text-decoration-skip-ink: none).
> 
> It requires permission for all websites to inject the CSS. The extension will never be sold or modified beyond this release.

I also plan to never update this repository beyond the initial 1.0 tag.
